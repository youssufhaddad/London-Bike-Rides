# 🚲 London Bike Rides

As a data analyst who is passionate about delving into practical insights, I set out to find trends in the data on bike rides in London. The dataset, which came from Kaggle, offered a wealth of knowledge just waiting to be uncovered. I took on this project to improve my abilities by demonstrating my prowess in data cleansing, storytelling, and visualization.


## ✏️ Data Wrangling

Conducted simple data wrangling and data cleaning:
- Renamed the columns to a proper names
- Changed the humidity values to percentage
- Created a season dictionary so that we can map the integers 0-3 to the actual written values
  
  0 spring , 1 summer , 2 fall , 3 winter .
- Created a weather dictionary so that we can map the integers to the actual written values
   
  1 Clear  , 2 scattered clouds, 3 Broken clouds , 4 Cloudy ,  7 Rain , 10 rain with thunderstorm , 26 = snowfall .
